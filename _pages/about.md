Hello, welcome to my personal page!

I am currently a Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer at [Qualcomm AI Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence/ai-research) working on efficient video generative AI. My work significantly contributed to the following: 
- First on-device deep-learning-based video denoising solution at high resolution (QHD and 4K at 30FPS) and an associated patent
- Two papers (one accepted at ECCV 2024 and the other is under review) and two patents about efficient video diffusion models
- The fastest diffusion-based mobile video editing demo on-device (NeurIPS 2024 demo)

Prior to that, I completed a Master’s degree at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) in Robotics and Computer Vision (RCV) Lab under supervision of [Prof. In So Kweon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XA8EOlEAAAAJ&hl=en). My primary focus was on adversarial machine learning and its applications in multimedia. This work led to several publications in top-tier conferences and workshops such as CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, and others.

**I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so please feel free to reach out!**

<!-- Prior to my graduate studies, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), where I interned in several research labs and worked on projects in computer vision, multimedia, and computer graphics. In addition, I interned at a robotics company, where I contributed to the development of a robotic vision system.

<!-- Overall, I have a good knowledge of current research trends in machine learning and ability to tackle open-ended problems with no clear or known solutions. In addition, I have a lot of experience working in small, quickly iterating research and engineering teams.

In my free time, among other things, I enjoy watching movies and TV series, playing football, board games, and table tennis. -->
